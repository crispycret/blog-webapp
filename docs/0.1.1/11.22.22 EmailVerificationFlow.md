Email Verification Flow

Register -> Login -> Email verification Check 
-> Yes -> Continue
-> No  -> redirect to page that expresses that the email needs to be verified.
->     -> Page should have an email verification text box to submit email code. 

-> Email Verification is sent
-> Email contains a code that can be used to verify the email manually or a link that has
a verification token baked into the url that when visited brings you to the website, 
the website then takes this token and sends it to the backend to verify the users email.


-> Once Email Verified the website continues on to the original destination intended by the user
